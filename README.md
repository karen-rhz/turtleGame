# 🐢💨 Turtle Racing
Is it really gambling if you know you're going to win? 👀

The turtle racing game is a gambling game, but when you win, you only get a "Congratulation! 🎉" from the terminal.

## How to play
- Run the program
- You'll be asked to choose who do you think is going to win 🎲 Make your bet 
- The race will begin after you make your bet and watch them compete for the first place
- Once the race is over, look at the terminal for the final result

Thank you for stopping by 👋
